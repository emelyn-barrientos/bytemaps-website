# About Bytemaps 👾 # 

This project is currently WIP!

I'm making a custom website for local Wellington artist, Bytemaps. The brief is to create a site where the artist can easily upload and post high res videos of his artwork as a curated digital gallery (Instagram compresses the video quality, thus the conception of this project).

To challenge myself, I've decided to work with the Wordpress Headless CMS (so the client can upload content on his own) and integrate it with Next.js. So far, I'm loving learning how to use new tools like WPGraphQL and Apollo Client.

## TECH USED 👩🏽‍💻 ##
- JavaScript
- React.js
- Next.js
- Sass/SCSS
- Contentful Headless CMS
- Webhooks
- Vercel (deployment)


## NEXT STEPS ▶️ ##

- [X] Reconnect info.js page with Contentful Headless CMS
- [X] Add next/fonts to project
- [ ] Re-organize file structure
- [ ] Finishing styling
- [ ] Clean up and refactor code

I'll update this README.md when the project is successfully deployed for your viewing pleasure :)
